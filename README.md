# top-twenty-risk-and-top-two-counter-party
A basic RISK algorythm in PYTHON to list top-twenty, position risks and volume counter parties

*** IN PROGRESS - will refactor and update shortly ***

(1) Counter party names are derived in code form the file names.

(2) Code will process all .csv files in the working dir,  so all other files in working dir that are not meant for processing should have no extensions or extesinos other than .csv

(3) Originally written to process twenty (20) counter parties' trading activity, but shortened down to two to limit the amoutn of smaple files needed for processing in this example.

(4) Refactoring for large volume optimization in progress
